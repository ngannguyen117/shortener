# Shortener

Implement a simple URL shortening service in Python as efficiently as possible. A Django project has been set up for you
if you choose to use it.

Your URL shortener should include the following:

* An endpoint that receives a URL and returns a new shortened URL
* An endpoint to retrieve the last 100 shortened URLs
* An endpoint to retrieve the top 10 most popular shortened domains in the past month
* An endpoint to retrieve the number of times a shortened URL has been visited.

## Instructions

1. Install the python environment using `pipenv install`.
2. Run the pre-defined tests using `pipenv run test`.
3. Implement the Django  views located in shortener/views.py to make tests pass and complete the shortener.
